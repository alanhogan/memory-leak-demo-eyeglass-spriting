## eyeglass spriting memory leak demo

Clone the repository, then run `npm install`.

Running `./build.js` will generate the spritemaps and css in the `dist` directory and serve files from here. An example of sprites usage will run at `localhost:8080`. Compilation will only use node-sass, eyeglass and eyeglass-spriting.

Alternatively, run `rm -rf dist; broccoli build dist` to use broccoli-eyeglass (and the above). This won't serve anything.
